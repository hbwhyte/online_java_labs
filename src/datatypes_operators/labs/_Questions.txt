Answer the following questions:


1.) What are the names and uses of Java's eight primitive types?

2.) How do you declare and initialize an int variable called "x" with the value 42.

3.) What happens if you initialize a double variable with the value of a int?

4.) How do you set an int variable to the value of a double?

5.) What are the 5 arithmetic operators?

6.) What are Relational operators used for? What is the result of using a relational operator?

7.) Demonstrate the use of a Relational operator.

8.) What logical operators used for? What is the result of using a logical operator?

9.) Demonstrate the use of a logical operator.

10.) How can you use the shorthand addition operator to add 10 to a variable "x"?

11.) What data type is a String?

12.) Are string mutable?

13.) How do you concatenate Strings?

14.) Can you cast and int to a String or a String to an int? Why or why not?

15.) What is an array?
    An array is a group or collection of variables of the same type, referred to by a common name. It is an ordered
    indexed list.

16.) What is the first index of an array?
    Zero. Always zero.

17.) Can you change the size of an array once it has been declared and initialized?
    After it has been declared no, but you can set the length when you initialize it.

18.) How do you print the 5th element in an array "exampleArray"?
    System.out.println(exampleArray[4]);

19.) What are the two ways you can declare and initialize an array? Demonstrate both.
    DECLARING:
        type[] array-name = new type[size];
        int[] newArray = new int[4]; // A array of integers called "newArray" with a length of 10, indices 0-9

    INITIALIZING:

        // Method 1
        int[] newArray = {1, 2, 3, 4}; // Array of 4 integers named "newArray" that has populated values [1, 2, 3, 4]

        // Method 2 (after the array has already been declared)
        newArray[0] = 1;
        newArray[1] = 2;
        newArray[2] = 3;
        newArray[3] = 4;

        //Multidimensional Array
           int[][]

20.) How do you iterate through a multidimensional array?
        Need nested loop(s).

        // Nested loop #1
        This is to populate the array. The first (outer) loop runs while i < newArray.length.
        The second (inner) loop needs to be in relation to newArray[i].length.

        //Nested loop #2
        This is to print the array. needs a System.out.print() as well as System.out.println() for formatting

21.) What is the for-each loop used for?

        For whenever you want to access every piece of data in a collection
        Functionally equivalent, but a bit more concise and elegant.
        However, doesn't have an index, so you can't use that if you need the index.
        Also called "enhanced for loop".

        // Example (1D)
        for (int i : newArray) {   // For each int (temp calling i) in the array newArray, do ____________
            System.out.println(i)
        }

        // Example (2D)
        for (int [] arr : newArray) {
            for (int i : arr) {
                System.out.print(i + "\t| ")
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
