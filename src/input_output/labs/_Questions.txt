Answer the following questions:

1.) What is a byte stream?
    A way to stream (read/write) data to or from a file byte by byte, or 8 bits at a time. Good for when you are
    streaming data that is NOT in human language/characters, you can use byte streams.

2.) What is a character stream?
    A way to stream (read/write) data to or from a file character by character (16 bits) at a time. Because char
    is in Unicode, this is useful when you want to process text files

3.) What two classes are at the top of the the byte stream hierarchy?
    InputStream and OutputStream

4.) What two classes are at the top of the the character stream hierarchy?
    Reader and Writer

5.) List at least three byte stream classes.
    FileInputStream and FileOutputStream
    BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream
    ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream

6.) List at least three character stream classes.
    BufferedReader, BufferedWriter
    FileReader and FileWriter
    StringReader and StringWriter

7.) What is a try-with-resources?
    A try statement that accesses object(s), aka resources, outside of the program, and makes sure to close
    the connection at the end of the statement. Any object that implements java.lang.AutoCloseable or
    java.io.Closeable can be used as a resource.


8.) What makes the BufferedReader different from the BufferedInputStream?
    BufferedReader is a character stream, BufferedInputStream is a byte stream.

9.) When would you use the read() method vs. the readline() method?
    Read() if you want each character, or if there isn't intrinsic value in separating line by line. readLine() is
    great for csv, arrays,
