Answer the following questions:

1.) What is the if statement used for?
    To let the program know which of various options it should do, based on conditions

2.) What is good real life application of a switch statement?
    When there are a finite number of options (e.g. days in a week, floors on an elevator, etc.)

3.) What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?
    A do while loops evaluates the code at the bottom instead of the top, so it will run at least once. It does the
    program the first time, then evaluates whether or not while is true.

4.) What is the difference between a for loop and an enhanced for loop?
    A for loop iterates over a range of values, while an enhanced for loop (also known as a for-each loop) is for
     iterating over a collection such as an array. Instead of having the 3 sections of initialize, condition, and
     iteration you use the following:

     for(type iteration-variable : collection){  // executable code }
     e.g.
     for (String item: arr) { // code} // arr being a predefined array full of items

5.) How do you create an infinite for loop?
    By leaving out conditions that would break the for loop, such as not setting a condition for it to stop

6.) What is the difference between the break statement and the continue statement?
    Break statement exits out of the loop, either to just outside of the loop if it is unlabelled, or to the location
    of the label if it has one. The continue statement stops the rest of the specific iteration from completing, but
    doesn't exit the loop. It jumps straight to the next iteration.

7.) Is there a limit to how many loops you can nest?
    No, but be careful of Big O complexity.

8.) Is there a limit to how many conditional statements you can nest?
    No.
